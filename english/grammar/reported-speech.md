title: English Reported Speech
---

# statements

form: Subject + said/told + (that) + clause with tense shift

use: To report what someone said without using their exact words

eg: Direct: "I am tired." → Reported: She said (that) she was tired

eg: Direct: "We are leaving." → Reported: They told us (that) they were leaving

tip: Use "said" without an object. Use "told" with an object (told me, told us). "That" is optional and often omitted in spoken English.

# tense changes

form: Shift the verb tense back in time when reporting past speech

use: When the reporting verb is in the past (said, told), the reported clause usually shifts to a past tense

eg: Direct: "I work here." → Reported: She said (that) she worked there. (Present simple → Past simple)

eg: Direct: "I am working." → Reported: He said (that) he was working. (Present continuous → Past continuous)

eg: Direct: "I have finished." → Reported: She said (that) she had finished. (Present perfect → Past perfect)

eg: Direct: "I saw him yesterday." → Reported: He said (that) he had seen him the day before. (Past simple → Past perfect)

eg: Direct: "I will help you." → Reported: She said (that) she would help me. (Will → Would)

eg: Direct: "I can swim." → Reported: He said (that) he could swim. (Can → Could)

eg: Direct: "I may be late." → Reported: She said (that) she might be late. (May → Might)

eg: Direct: "I must leave now." → Reported: He said (that) he had to leave then. (Must → Had to)

tip: Past perfect stays past perfect. There is no further backshift.

# pronoun changes

form: Change pronouns to match the perspective of the person reporting

use: First and second person pronouns shift to third person when reporting what someone else said

eg: Direct: "I am busy." → Reported: She said (that) she was busy. (I → she)

eg: Direct: "We need help." → Reported: They said (that) they needed help. (We → they)

eg: Direct: "This is my book." → Reported: He said (that) that was his book. (my → his)

eg: Direct: "You should call me." → Reported: She told him (that) he should call her. (you → he, me → her)

eg: Direct: "Our flight leaves tomorrow." → Reported: They said (that) their flight left the next day. (our → their)

tip: The pronoun changes depend on who said what and who is reporting. "I" becomes he/she (the original speaker). "You" becomes I/he/she (the person addressed).

# time and place changes

form: Shift time and place expressions to match the reporting context

use: Words that refer to "here and now" change when we report from a different time or place

eg: Direct: "I saw him today." → Reported: She said (that) she had seen him that day. (today → that day)

eg: Direct: "I met her yesterday." → Reported: He said (that) he had met her the day before. (yesterday → the day before / the previous day)

eg: Direct: "I will call you tomorrow." → Reported: She said (that) she would call me the next day. (tomorrow → the next day / the following day)

eg: Direct: "I am busy now." → Reported: He said (that) he was busy then. (now → then)

eg: Direct: "I live here." → Reported: She said (that) she lived there. (here → there)

eg: Direct: "I want this one." → Reported: He said (that) he wanted that one. (this → that)

eg: Direct: "I bought these yesterday." → Reported: She said (that) she had bought those the day before. (these → those)

eg: Direct: "I saw him two days ago." → Reported: He said (that) he had seen him two days before. (ago → before)

eg: Direct: "I was there last week." → Reported: She said (that) she had been there the week before. (last week → the week before / the previous week)

eg: Direct: "I am leaving next week." → Reported: He said (that) he was leaving the following week. (next week → the following week)

tip: These changes are not always necessary if the time/place is still the same when reporting.

# questions

form: Yes/No: Subject + asked + if/whether + subject + verb (no inversion). Wh-: Subject + asked + wh-word + subject + verb (no inversion)

use: To report questions. The word order becomes statement order (subject before verb). No do/does/did in reported form.

eg: Direct: "Do you speak English?" → Reported: She asked if I spoke English. (Yes/No with do)

eg: Direct: "Are you coming?" → Reported: He asked whether I was coming. (Yes/No with be)

eg: Direct: "Have you finished?" → Reported: She asked if I had finished. (Yes/No with have)

eg: Direct: "Where do you live?" → Reported: He asked where I lived. (Wh- question)

eg: Direct: "What time does it start?" → Reported: She asked what time it started. (Wh- question)

eg: Direct: "Why did you leave?" → Reported: He asked why I had left. (Wh- question)

eg: Direct: "Who is that?" → Reported: She asked who that was. (Wh- question)

tip: Never use inversion in reported questions. Wrong: She asked where did I live. Correct: She asked where I lived.

# commands and requests

form: told/asked + object + (not) + to-infinitive

use: To report orders, commands, and requests. Use "told" for commands, "asked" for polite requests.

eg: Direct: "Close the door." → Reported: He told me to close the door.

eg: Direct: "Please help me." → Reported: She asked me to help her.

eg: Direct: "Don't touch that." → Reported: He told me not to touch that.

eg: Direct: "Please don't leave." → Reported: She asked me not to leave.

eg: Direct: "Wait for me." → Reported: He told us to wait for him.

tip: Negative commands use "not to" before the infinitive. "Told" implies a stronger instruction than "asked."

# suggestions and advice

form: suggested + gerund / suggested (that) + subject + verb / advised + object + to-infinitive

use: To report suggestions, advice, and recommendations

eg: Direct: "Let's go to the cinema." → Reported: She suggested going to the cinema. / She suggested that we go to the cinema.

eg: Direct: "You should see a doctor." → Reported: He advised me to see a doctor.

eg: Direct: "Why don't you try again?" → Reported: She suggested that I try again. / She suggested trying again.

eg: Direct: "You ought to rest." → Reported: He advised me to rest.

eg: Direct: "How about having lunch?" → Reported: She suggested having lunch.

tip: "Suggest" can take a gerund or "that" + base form. "Advise" takes "to" + infinitive with an object.

# reporting verbs

form: Different verbs take different patterns: verb + that clause, verb + object + to-infinitive, verb + gerund, etc.

use: Choose the right reporting verb and pattern for the meaning

eg: say: She said (that) she was leaving. (say + that clause)

eg: tell: He told me (that) he would come. (tell + object + that clause)

eg: ask: She asked if I could help. / She asked me to help. (ask + if/whether or ask + object + to-infinitive)

eg: advise: He advised me to see a doctor. (advise + object + to-infinitive)

eg: warn: She warned me not to go there. (warn + object + (not) to-infinitive)

eg: suggest: He suggested going early. / He suggested that we go early. (suggest + gerund or that clause)

eg: offer: She offered to help me. (offer + to-infinitive)

eg: promise: He promised to call. (promise + to-infinitive)

eg: refuse: She refused to answer. (refuse + to-infinitive)

eg: deny: He denied taking the money. (deny + gerund)

eg: admit: She admitted making a mistake. (admit + gerund)

eg: explain: He explained that he had been delayed. (explain + that clause)

eg: complain: She complained that the service was slow. (complain + that clause)

eg: insist: He insisted that he was right. (insist + that clause)

eg: remind: She reminded me to buy milk. (remind + object + to-infinitive)

eg: encourage: He encouraged me to apply. (encourage + object + to-infinitive)

eg: beg: She begged me not to leave. (beg + object + (not) to-infinitive)

eg: demand: He demanded to see the manager. (demand + to-infinitive)

eg: recommend: She recommended visiting the museum. (recommend + gerund)

eg: claim: He claimed that he had been elsewhere. (claim + that clause)

eg: agree: She agreed to help. (agree + to-infinitive)

eg: announce: They announced that the flight was delayed. (announce + that clause)

tip: Learn which pattern each verb takes. "Say" never takes an object before "that." "Tell" always needs an object.

# when NOT to change tense

form: Keep the original tense when the situation is still true, when reporting immediately, or when the clause is already past perfect

use: Backshift is not always required. Use your judgment about whether the situation has changed.

eg: Direct: "The earth goes around the sun." → Reported: She said (that) the earth goes around the sun. (General truth, still true)

eg: Direct: "I love chocolate." → Reported: He said (that) he loves chocolate. (Habit or preference that may still be true)

eg: Direct: "I am tired." (said 2 seconds ago) → Reported: She says she is tired. (Reporting verb in present when reporting something just said)

eg: Direct: "I had already left when he called." → Reported: She said (that) she had already left when he called. (Past perfect stays past perfect)

eg: Direct: "Paris is the capital of France." → Reported: He said (that) Paris is the capital of France. (Fact that does not change)

tip: When in doubt, backshifting is usually safe. Not backshifting can suggest the information is still current.

# common mistakes

form: Avoid these errors when using reported speech

use: Awareness of common mistakes helps learners produce correct reported speech

eg: Wrong: She asked where did I live. Correct: She asked where I lived. (Wrong word order in reported questions)

eg: Wrong: She said me that she was tired. Correct: She told me that she was tired. (Use "told" with an object, not "said")

eg: Wrong: He said that he will come tomorrow. Correct: He said that he would come the next day. (Forgetting tense and time changes)

eg: Wrong: She asked me that I help her. Correct: She asked me to help her. (Use to-infinitive for requests, not that clause)

eg: Wrong: He told that he was leaving. Correct: He said that he was leaving. / He told me that he was leaving. (Tell needs an object)

eg: Wrong: She said "I am busy" yesterday. Correct: She said (that) she was busy yesterday. (Don't mix direct and reported speech)

tip: Practice the three main changes: tense, pronouns, and time/place words. Check word order in reported questions.
