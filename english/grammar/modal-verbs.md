# can vs. could vs. be able to

use: When to use each for ability
eg: Present ability: "I can swim" / "I am able to swim" (can is more natural)

eg: Future ability: "I will be able to drive next year" (can has no future form)
eg: Infinitive/gerund needed: "I want to be able to speak French" (can has no infinitive)

tip: Use "can" for present ability when possible — it's shorter and more common
tip: Use "be able to" when you need tenses "can" doesn't have — future, infinitive, perfect forms
tip: For past single events where someone succeeded, "managed to" or "was able to" — "could" suggests general ability only

# must vs. have to vs. need to

use: Obligation differences — internal vs external, strength
eg: Internal obligation (you feel it): "I must exercise more"
eg: External obligation (rules, boss, situation): "I have to wear a uniform at work"
eg: Necessity (practical): "I need to buy milk"
eg: Negative — prohibition: "You mustn't park here" (it's forbidden)
eg: Negative — no obligation: "You don't have to come" (optional) / "You needn't come" (British)

tip: "Must" and "have to" are often interchangeable for affirmative obligation, but "must" feels more personal
tip: "Mustn't" = prohibited; "don't have to" = not required (you can if you want) — these are opposites!
tip: "Have to" has all tense forms; "must" has no past — use "had to" for past obligation

# should vs. ought to vs. had better

use: Degrees of advice and strength
eg: Mild advice: "You should try the soup" (good idea)
eg: Slightly stronger/formal: "You ought to see a doctor" (advisable)
eg: Strong advice with consequence: "You had better hurry or you'll miss it" (warning)

tip: "Had better" is not used for general advice, only specific situations with implied threat

# may vs. might vs. could (possibility)

use: Degrees of certainty for possibility
eg: More likely (formal): "It may rain tomorrow" (perhaps 50%)
eg: Less likely: "It might rain tomorrow" (perhaps 30%)
eg: Theoretical possibility: "It could rain tomorrow" (possible, not ruled out)

tip: In practice, "may," "might," and "could" are often used interchangeably for possibility
tip: "Might" traditionally suggests lower probability than "may," but many speakers don't distinguish
