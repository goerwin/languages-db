# defining relative clauses

form: Noun + relative pronoun + clause (no commas)

use: To identify or define which person or thing we are talking about; the clause is essential to the meaning

eg: The woman who lives next door is a doctor

eg: The book that I borrowed from the library was fascinating

eg: This is the restaurant where we had our first date

eg: The man whose car was stolen reported it to the police

eg: I remember the day when we first met

eg: The reason why I called was to ask about the meeting

tip: The relative pronoun can often be omitted when it is the object of the clause

# non-defining relative clauses

form: Noun + comma + relative pronoun + clause + comma (or period)

use: To add extra information about a person or thing; the clause is not essential to the meaning

eg: My sister, who lives in Paris, is visiting next week

eg: The Eiffel Tower, which was built in 1889, is a famous landmark

eg: Our teacher, whose wife is a lawyer, gave us extra homework

eg: We stayed at the Grand Hotel, where many celebrities have stayed

eg: I'll never forget Christmas 2020, when we couldn't see our family

tip: Never use "that" in non-defining clauses; use who or which. Never omit the relative pronoun.

# who

form: who + verb (subject) or who + subject + verb (object)

use: For people in both subject and object positions

eg: The woman who called you is my mother (defining, subject)

eg: The man who I met yesterday was very friendly (defining, object)

eg: My brother, who works in finance, just got promoted (non-defining, subject)

eg: Sarah, who I've known for years, is getting married (non-defining, object)

tip: In informal English, "who" is often used instead of "whom" even when it is the object

# whom

form: whom + subject + verb (object position)

use: For people when they are the object of the verb or follow a preposition; formal style

eg: The person to whom I spoke was very helpful

eg: The candidate whom we interviewed seemed qualified

eg: She is someone for whom I have great respect

tip: In modern spoken English, "who" is commonly used instead of "whom" except after prepositions in formal writing

# which

form: which + verb (subject) or which + subject + verb (object)

use: For things and animals; in non-defining clauses can refer to a whole clause

eg: The book which is on the table belongs to me (defining, subject)

eg: The movie which we watched was excellent (defining, object)

eg: The dog, which was rescued last year, is very friendly (non-defining)

eg: He passed the exam, which surprised everyone (non-defining, refers to whole clause)

eg: She said she was busy, which was not true (non-defining, refers to whole clause)

tip: When "which" refers to a whole clause, it always appears in non-defining clauses with a comma

# that

form: that + verb (subject) or that + subject + verb (object)

use: For people and things in defining clauses only; often preferred after certain words

eg: The man that lives next door is a doctor

eg: The book that I read was fascinating

eg: This is the best movie that I have ever seen (preferred after superlatives)

eg: Everything that she said was true (preferred after all, everything, nothing, anything)

eg: The first thing that I noticed was the smell (preferred after ordinals)

tip: Never use "that" in non-defining clauses; use who or which instead

# whose

form: whose + noun + verb

use: To show possession; works for both people and things

eg: The man whose car was stolen reported it to the police

eg: She's the student whose essay won the prize

eg: The house whose roof was damaged in the storm needs repairs

eg: The company, whose CEO resigned yesterday, is in crisis

tip: "Whose" can replace "of which" for things: "a house whose roof" = "a house the roof of which"

# where

form: where + subject + verb

use: For places; indicates location

eg: This is the town where I grew up

eg: The hotel where we stayed was very comfortable

eg: I went back to the place where we first met

eg: The office, where I work, is in the city center

tip: "Where" can often be replaced by "in which" or "at which" in more formal contexts

# when

form: when + subject + verb

use: For times; indicates when something happened

eg: I remember the day when we first met

eg: There was a time when I didn't believe in love

eg: Summer is the season when I feel happiest

eg: 2020, when the pandemic started, was a difficult year

tip: "When" can be replaced by "in which", "on which", or "at which" depending on the preposition needed

# why

form: why + subject + verb

use: For reasons; typically used with "the reason"

eg: The reason why I called was to ask about the meeting

eg: I don't understand the reason why she left

eg: That's the reason why we need to act now

eg: The reason that I'm late is the traffic (that is also possible)

tip: "Why" is less common than "that" after "the reason" in informal English

# omitting the relative pronoun

form: Noun + clause (no relative pronoun)

use: Only when the relative pronoun is the object of the clause; never when it is the subject

eg: The movie (that) I watched was great (that = object, can omit)

eg: The man (who/that) I met yesterday was friendly (object, can omit)

eg: The book (which/that) she recommended is excellent (object, can omit)

eg: The man who lives next door is nice (who = subject, cannot omit)

eg: The woman who called you is my mother (who = subject, cannot omit)

tip: If you can add a pronoun after the verb (e.g. "I watched it"), the relative pronoun is the object and can be omitted

# prepositions in relative clauses

form: Formal: preposition + whom/which; Informal: who/which/that + clause + preposition at end

use: When the verb in the relative clause takes a preposition

eg: The person to whom I spoke was very helpful (formal)

eg: The person who I spoke to was very helpful (informal)

eg: The house in which she was born has been demolished (formal)

eg: The house which she was born in has been demolished (informal)

eg: This is the project on which we've been working (formal)

eg: This is the project that we've been working on (informal)

tip: In informal English, the preposition usually goes at the end of the clause

# common mistakes

form: Correct structure vs incorrect structure

use: Avoiding typical errors with relative clauses

eg: My sister, who lives in Paris, is visiting (correct: commas for non-defining)

eg: My sister, that lives in Paris, is visiting (wrong: never use "that" in non-defining)

eg: The man who I saw was tall (correct)

eg: The man who I saw him was tall (wrong: do not add extra pronoun "him")

eg: The book, which I borrowed, was fascinating (correct: comma before "which" in non-defining)

eg: The book which I borrowed was fascinating (correct if defining; wrong if non-defining and comma is needed)

eg: The woman lives next door is a doctor (wrong: missing "who" — subject cannot be omitted)

eg: The woman who lives next door is a doctor (correct)

tip: Check if the clause is essential (no commas) or extra information (commas). Never double the object with an extra pronoun.
