# present simple passive

form: Subject + am/is/are + past participle
neg: Subject + am/is/are + not + past participle
q: Am/Is/Are + subject + past participle + ?

use: For present habits, routines, or facts in passive form
eg: English is spoken in many countries
eg: The office is cleaned every evening
eg: Coffee is grown in Brazil

use: For general truths or permanent situations
eg: The museum is visited by thousands each year
eg: Letters are delivered every morning

active: They clean the office every evening
passive: The office is cleaned every evening

tip: Use is for he/she/it and singular nouns, are for they/we/you and plural nouns, am for I
tip: Don't forget the past participle (V3); "is clean" is wrong, "is cleaned" is correct

# present continuous passive

form: Subject + am/is/are + being + past participle
neg: Subject + am/is/are + not + being + past participle
q: Am/Is/Are + subject + being + past participle + ?

use: For actions happening right now or around now in passive form
eg: The house is being painted this week
eg: A new road is being built near the city center

use: For temporary situations in progress
eg: The report is being prepared by the team
eg: Your order is being processed

active: They are painting the house this week
passive: The house is being painted this week

tip: Always use "being" between am/is/are and the past participle; "is painted" means present simple, "is being painted" means in progress
tip: This form is less common than present simple passive; use it only when the action is clearly ongoing

# present perfect passive

form: Subject + has/have + been + past participle
neg: Subject + has/have + not + been + past participle
q: Has/Have + subject + been + past participle + ?

use: For past actions with present results or relevance
eg: The work has been completed
eg: The letter has been sent

use: For experiences or actions at an unspecified time in the past
eg: This book has been translated into 20 languages
eg: The window has been broken

active: Someone has completed the work
passive: The work has been completed

tip: Use has for he/she/it and singular nouns, have for I/we/you/they and plural nouns
tip: Don't confuse with past simple passive; "has been done" emphasizes the result now, "was done" focuses on when

# past simple passive

form: Subject + was/were + past participle
neg: Subject + was/were + not + past participle
q: Was/Were + subject + past participle + ?

use: For completed actions in the past when the time or result matters
eg: The building was constructed in 1920
eg: The letter was delivered yesterday

use: For past events where the doer is unknown or unimportant
eg: My bike was stolen last night
eg: The meeting was cancelled

active: They constructed the building in 1920
passive: The building was constructed in 1920

tip: Use was for I/he/she/it and singular nouns, were for we/you/they and plural nouns
tip: Often used with time expressions like yesterday, last week, in 1920

# past continuous passive

form: Subject + was/were + being + past participle
neg: Subject + was/were + not + being + past participle
q: Was/Were + subject + being + past participle + ?

use: For actions in progress at a specific time in the past
eg: The car was being repaired when I called
eg: The documents were being checked all morning

use: For background actions interrupted by another event
eg: The house was being renovated when they decided to sell
eg: The report was being written when the power went out

active: They were repairing the car when I called
passive: The car was being repaired when I called

tip: This form is rare; past simple passive is often used instead when the continuous aspect is not essential
tip: "Being" must come between was/were and the past participle

# past perfect passive

form: Subject + had + been + past participle
neg: Subject + had + not + been + past participle
q: Had + subject + been + past participle + ?

use: For actions completed before another past action or time
eg: The room had been cleaned before the guests arrived
eg: The report had been finished by noon

use: For past actions with results that affected a later past situation
eg: The bridge had been damaged by the storm
eg: The tickets had already been sold when we arrived

active: Someone had cleaned the room before the guests arrived
passive: The room had been cleaned before the guests arrived

tip: Use when you need to show one past action happened before another; often used with "before" or "by the time"
tip: Had is the same for all subjects; do not use "had been being" for past perfect continuous passive (avoid that form)

# future simple passive (will)

form: Subject + will + be + past participle
neg: Subject + will + not + be + past participle
q: Will + subject + be + past participle + ?

use: For predictions or future facts in passive form
eg: The project will be completed next month
eg: You will be notified when it is ready

use: For promises, offers, or decisions about the future
eg: The bill will be sent to your address
eg: The problem will be fixed soon

active: They will complete the project next month
passive: The project will be completed next month

tip: Use "be" not "been" after will; "will be done" is correct, "will been done" is wrong
tip: Going to passive is also possible: "The project is going to be completed next month"

# future perfect passive

form: Subject + will + have + been + past participle
neg: Subject + will + not + have + been + past participle
q: Will + subject + have + been + past participle + ?

use: For actions that will be completed before a future time or event
eg: The house will have been sold by next summer
eg: All applications will have been reviewed by Friday

use: For projecting completion of ongoing work
eg: The repairs will have been finished by the time you return
eg: The report will have been submitted before the deadline

active: They will have sold the house by next summer
passive: The house will have been sold by next summer

tip: Often used with "by" plus a future time; "by Friday", "by next year"
tip: This form is formal and less common in everyday speech

# modal verbs in passive

form: Subject + modal + be + past participle (present/future)
form: Subject + modal + have + been + past participle (past)
neg: Subject + modal + not + be/have been + past participle
q: Modal + subject + be/have been + past participle + ?

use: For ability, permission, obligation, or necessity in passive form
eg: The work can be done by Friday
eg: The report must be finished today
eg: He should be told the truth
eg: The door might be locked

use: For past modals in passive
eg: The letter should have been sent yesterday
eg: The work could have been completed earlier
eg: The problem must have been fixed

active: They can do the work by Friday
passive: The work can be done by Friday

tip: After modals use the base form "be" not "been" for present/future; "can be done" not "can been done"
tip: For past passive with modals use "have been"; "should have been told" not "should be told" when referring to the past

# passive with "get"

form: Subject + get/gets/got + past participle
neg: Subject + do/does/did + not + get + past participle
q: Do/Does/Did + subject + get + past participle + ?

use: Informal alternative to be-passive, often for unexpected or negative events
eg: My bike got stolen last night
eg: She got promoted last year
eg: He got hurt in the accident

use: For changes of state or situations that happen to someone
eg: We got stuck in traffic
eg: The window got broken

active: Someone stole my bike last night
passive: My bike got stolen last night

tip: Get is more informal than be; use be-passive in formal or academic writing
tip: Get-passive is common with verbs like hurt, stolen, broken, damaged, promoted; avoid with formal or technical contexts

# when to use passive voice

use: When the agent (doer) is unknown
eg: My wallet was stolen
eg: The window has been broken

use: When the agent is unimportant or obvious
eg: The suspect was arrested
eg: English is spoken here

use: When you want to emphasize the action or the result rather than who did it
eg: The new bridge was opened yesterday
eg: The experiment was conducted under controlled conditions

use: In formal or academic writing to sound objective
eg: The data was analyzed using statistical methods
eg: It has been suggested that further research is needed

tip: Passive shifts focus from who does the action to what happens to the object
tip: In scientific writing passive is standard to keep focus on the process and results

# when NOT to use passive voice

use: Intransitive verbs have no passive form; they have no object to become the subject
eg: She arrived (not "was arrived")
eg: The baby slept (not "was slept")
eg: Something happened (not "was happened")

use: When active voice is clearer or more direct
eg: I love this book (clearer than "This book is loved by me")
eg: The manager made the decision (clearer than "The decision was made by the manager")

use: When you want to emphasize who did the action
eg: John wrote this report (not passive, to highlight John)

tip: Verbs like arrive, sleep, happen, die, exist, occur have no passive
tip: If "by someone" sounds awkward or unnecessary, use active voice instead

# by + agent

use: Include "by" when the agent is important, surprising, or needs to be identified
eg: The play was written by Shakespeare
eg: The building was designed by a famous architect
eg: The letter was sent by my sister

use: Omit "by" when the agent is unknown, obvious, or unimportant
eg: The window was broken (we don't know who)
eg: The suspect was arrested (obviously by police)
eg: Rice is grown in Asia (general, no specific agent)

tip: "By" comes after the past participle; "was written by" not "was by written"
tip: With "get" passive, "by" is less common; "got hit by a car" is possible but "got hit" often stands alone

# common mistakes with passive voice

use: Wrong past participle
eg: The work was did (wrong) / The work was done (correct)
eg: The letter was send (wrong) / The letter was sent (correct)

use: Missing "be" in continuous or perfect passive
eg: The house is painted (present simple) vs The house is being painted (present continuous)
eg: The work has done (wrong) / The work has been done (correct)

use: Using passive with intransitive verbs
eg: He was arrived (wrong) / He arrived (correct)
eg: The accident was happened (wrong) / The accident happened (correct)

use: Confusing active and passive structure
eg: The book was written by me (passive) vs I wrote the book (active)
eg: Avoid mixing: "The letter was sent by John" is passive; "John sent the letter" is active

tip: Always check: does the verb take an object? Only transitive verbs can be made passive
tip: In questions, the auxiliary (am/is/are/was/were/has/have/had/will) comes before the subject; "Was the letter sent?" not "The letter was sent?"
