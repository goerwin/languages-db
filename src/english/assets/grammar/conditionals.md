# zero conditional

form: If + present simple, present simple
neg: If + subject + do/does + not + base verb, subject + do/does + not + base verb
q: (Questions are rare with zero conditional)

use: For general truths and scientific facts — things that are always true
eg: If you heat water to 100°C, it boils
eg: If it rains, the grass gets wet
eg: If you mix blue and yellow, you get green

use: For instructions and general rules
eg: If the alarm goes off, leave the building immediately
eg: If you press this button, the machine starts
eg: If you see something suspicious, report it to security

use: For habits and routines that always follow the same pattern
eg: If I wake up early, I feel more productive
eg: If she drinks coffee after 3pm, she can't sleep
eg: If we have a meeting, we prepare notes beforehand

tip: You can replace "if" with "when" in zero conditionals without changing the meaning
tip: Both clauses use the present simple tense
tip: The if-clause and the main clause can be swapped: "Water boils if you heat it to 100°C"

# first conditional

form: If + present simple, will + base verb
neg: If + subject + do/does + not + base verb, subject + will + not + base verb
q: What will happen if + present simple? / Will + subject + base verb if + present simple?

use: For real or likely future situations
eg: If it rains tomorrow, I will stay at home
eg: If you study hard, you will pass the exam
eg: If she calls, I will tell her the news

use: For promises, threats, and offers
eg: If you finish your homework, I will take you to the cinema
eg: If you don't stop, I will call the police
eg: If you're hungry, I will make you a sandwich

use: For warnings and advice about future consequences
eg: If you don't wear sunscreen, you will get sunburned
eg: If we miss the train, we will be late for the meeting
eg: If you touch that wire, you will get an electric shock

tip: "Will" can be replaced with other modals: can, may, might, should, must (e.g. If you hurry, you might catch the bus)
tip: The if-clause can use present continuous for plans: If you're coming to the party, let me know
tip: Avoid using "will" in the if-clause — "If you will come" is wrong; use "If you come" instead

# second conditional

form: If + past simple, would + base verb
neg: If + subject + did + not + base verb, subject + would + not + base verb
q: What would you do if + past simple? / Would + subject + base verb if + past simple?

use: For unreal or hypothetical present situations
eg: If I had more time, I would learn to play the piano
eg: If she lived closer, we would see each other more often
eg: If I were rich, I would travel the world

use: For unlikely or imaginary future situations
eg: If I won the lottery, I would buy a house by the sea
eg: If it snowed in summer, everyone would be surprised
eg: If aliens landed tomorrow, scientists would study them

use: For giving advice (softening suggestions)
eg: If I were you, I would apologise
eg: If you asked nicely, she would probably help
eg: If you exercised more, you would feel better

tip: Use "were" instead of "was" for all persons in formal English: If I were you (not "If I was you")
tip: "Was" is acceptable in informal spoken English: If he was here, he'd help
tip: Second conditional expresses low probability — the speaker doesn't expect the condition to happen

# third conditional

form: If + past perfect, would have + past participle
neg: If + subject + had + not + past participle, subject + would + not + have + past participle
q: What would you have done if + past perfect? / Would + subject + have + past participle if + past perfect?

use: For unreal past situations and regrets
eg: If I had known, I would have told you
eg: If she had studied harder, she would have passed the exam
eg: If we had left earlier, we wouldn't have missed the flight

use: For criticising past actions or decisions
eg: If you had listened to me, this wouldn't have happened
eg: If they had checked the weather, they wouldn't have gone hiking
eg: If he had been more careful, the accident wouldn't have occurred

use: For imagining different outcomes of past events
eg: If I had taken that job, I would have moved to London
eg: If the team had scored one more goal, they would have won
eg: If she had said yes, they would be married now

tip: The condition and result both refer to the past — neither can be changed
tip: Common mistake: using "would have" in the if-clause — wrong: "If I would have known"; correct: "If I had known"
tip: Third conditional often expresses regret, relief, or criticism about past events

# mixed conditional: third + second

form: If + past perfect, would + base verb
neg: If + subject + had + not + past participle, subject + would + not + base verb
q: What would you do now if + past perfect? / Would + subject + base verb if + past perfect?

use: Past condition with present result — something that didn't happen in the past affects the present
eg: If I had studied medicine, I would be a doctor now
eg: If she had married him, she would live in Paris today
eg: If we had bought that house, we would own property by the sea

use: For past decisions with ongoing present consequences
eg: If you had saved money when you were young, you would have more security now
eg: If they had invested in that company, they would be wealthy today
eg: If he had learned English as a child, he would speak it fluently now

use: For regrets about past actions that still affect the present
eg: If I hadn't dropped out of university, I would have better job prospects now
eg: If she had taken the job offer, she would work in New York today
eg: If we had moved abroad, our children would speak another language now

tip: The if-clause describes an unreal past; the main clause describes an unreal present
tip: This structure connects a past hypothetical with a present hypothetical result
tip: Often used to express "if things had been different in the past, things would be different now"

# mixed conditional: second + third

form: If + past simple, would have + past participle
neg: If + subject + did + not + base verb, subject + would + not + have + past participle
q: (Rare) Would + subject + have + past participle if + past simple?

use: Present condition with past result — a present characteristic or habit that would have caused a past outcome
eg: If I were more organised, I would have finished the project on time
eg: If she liked flying, she would have taken the plane instead of the train
eg: If he were braver, he would have stood up to the bully

use: For present personality or ability affecting past hypothetical outcomes
eg: If you were a better listener, you would have understood what she meant
eg: If they were more experienced, they would have avoided that mistake
eg: If I were taller, I would have reached the top shelf

use: For general truths about someone that explain past events
eg: If he weren't so stubborn, he would have accepted the compromise
eg: If she were more patient, she would have waited for the right moment
eg: If we were less cautious, we would have taken more risks

tip: This structure is less common than third + second mixed conditional
tip: The if-clause describes a present unreal state; the main clause describes a past unreal result
tip: Often implies "because of who/what you are (now), this past outcome would have been different"

# unless

form: Unless + condition, result (equivalent to "if...not")
neg: Unless + subject + verb (positive), subject + negative verb
q: What will happen unless + condition? / Will + subject + base verb unless + condition?

use: Unless means "if not" — use when the condition must be false for the result to happen
eg: Unless you hurry, you will miss the train
eg: Unless it rains, we will have a picnic
eg: Unless she apologises, I won't speak to her

use: For exceptions and conditions that prevent something
eg: Unless you have a ticket, you cannot enter
eg: Unless the doctor says otherwise, you should rest
eg: Unless there's an emergency, don't call me after 10pm

use: For requirements and necessary conditions
eg: Unless you pay the fee, your application won't be processed
eg: Unless we get more funding, the project will be cancelled
eg: Unless he changes his attitude, he will lose his job

tip: Common mistake: double negative — wrong: "Unless you don't go" (redundant); correct: "Unless you go" or "If you don't go"
tip: "Unless" cannot replace "if" when the meaning is "if...not" in the result — "I'll be surprised if he doesn't come" (not "unless he comes" — different meaning)
tip: After "unless" use present tense for future meaning: Unless it rains tomorrow (not "unless it will rain")

# wish and if only

form: Wish / If only + past simple (for present wishes)
neg: Wish / If only + subject + did + not + base verb
eg: I wish I had more free time
eg: She wishes she spoke French
eg: If only I knew the answer
eg: He wishes he didn't have to work today
eg: If only we had a bigger house

use: For present wishes about things we want to be different now
eg: I wish I were taller
eg: She wishes she could sing
eg: If only they lived nearer
eg: I wish I didn't have a headache
eg: If only the weather were better

form: Wish / If only + past perfect (for past regrets)
neg: Wish / If only + subject + had + not + past participle
eg: I wish I had studied harder for the exam
eg: She wishes she hadn't said that
eg: If only we had left earlier
eg: He wishes he had taken the job
eg: If only I had listened to your advice

use: For regrets about past actions or situations
eg: I wish I had told her the truth
eg: She wishes she had gone to the party
eg: If only they had known about the problem sooner
eg: I wish I hadn't wasted so much time
eg: If only he had been more careful

form: Wish / If only + would (for complaints and desires for change)
neg: Wish / If only + subject + would + not + base verb
eg: I wish you would listen to me
eg: She wishes he would stop smoking
eg: If only the rain would stop
eg: I wish they wouldn't argue so much
eg: If only the baby would sleep through the night

use: For complaints about other people's behaviour (wanting them to change)
eg: I wish you would tidy your room
eg: She wishes her boss would give her more feedback
eg: If only he would call me back
eg: I wish the neighbours would be quieter
eg: If only she would make a decision

use: For desires about situations we want to change (often things outside our control)
eg: I wish it would stop raining
eg: She wishes the pain would go away
eg: If only things would get better
eg: I wish the bus would come
eg: If only summer would arrive

tip: Don't use "wish + would" for yourself — wrong: "I wish I would..." (use "I wish I could..." or "I wish I + past simple")
tip: "If only" is stronger and more emphatic than "wish" — expresses stronger regret or desire
tip: Use "were" not "was" after wish/if only for unreal present: I wish I were (formal); I wish I was (informal)
