---

# forming comparatives

form: Short adjectives (1 syllable): adjective + -er + than
form: Long adjectives (2+ syllables): more + adjective + than
form: Adjectives ending in -y: change -y to -ier + than
form: CVC adjectives (consonant-vowel-consonant): double final consonant + -er (big→bigger, hot→hotter, thin→thinner)
form: Adjectives ending in -e: add -r only (nice→nicer, large→larger, wise→wiser)

use: To compare two things, people, or situations
eg: She is taller than her brother
eg: This book is more interesting than the last one
eg: He is happier than he was last year
eg: My room is bigger than yours
eg: Today is hotter than yesterday
eg: This hotel is nicer than the one we stayed at last time

tip: One-syllable adjectives always take -er. Never use "more" with them
tip: For two-syllable adjectives not ending in -y, use "more" (more honest, more careful)
tip: CVC rule applies when the final consonant is preceded by a single vowel: big, hot, fat, thin, sad

# forming superlatives

form: Short adjectives (1 syllable): the + adjective + -est
form: Long adjectives (2+ syllables): the most + adjective
form: Adjectives ending in -y: change -y to -iest (the happiest, the busiest)
form: CVC adjectives: double final consonant + -est (the biggest, the hottest, the thinnest)
form: Adjectives ending in -e: add -st only (the nicest, the largest, the wisest)

use: To compare three or more things and identify the extreme
eg: She is the tallest girl in the class
eg: This is the most interesting book I have ever read
eg: He is the happiest person I know
eg: This is the biggest pizza I have ever seen
eg: August is the hottest month of the year
eg: She chose the nicest dress in the store

tip: Always use "the" before superlatives when they modify a noun
tip: Superlatives often appear with "in" (in the class) or "of" (of all)
tip: Never use "most" with -est forms (not "the most biggest")

# irregular comparatives and superlatives

form: good → better → best
form: bad → worse → worst
form: far → farther/further → farthest/furthest
form: little → less → least
form: much/many → more → most
form: old → older/elder → oldest/eldest

use: These adjectives do not follow the regular -er/-est or more/most patterns
eg: This coffee is better than the one I had yesterday
eg: She is the best student in the school
eg: The weather got worse as the day went on
eg: That was the worst movie I have ever seen
eg: The supermarket is farther than the corner shop
eg: I have less time now than I did before
eg: He has the least experience of all the candidates
eg: We need more water
eg: She has the most books in the family
eg: My elder brother lives abroad
eg: She is the eldest of three children

tip: "Farther" and "further" are both correct for distance; "further" is also used for abstract meaning (further discussion)
tip: "Elder" and "eldest" are used mainly for family members; "older" and "oldest" for everything else
tip: Memorize irregular forms as they cannot be predicted from the base adjective

# less and least

form: less + adjective + than (for comparatives)
form: the least + adjective (for superlatives)

use: To make opposite comparisons, showing lower degree or quality
eg: This movie is less interesting than the first one
eg: The new model is less expensive than the old one
eg: He is less confident than he used to be
eg: This is the least expensive option
eg: She chose the least complicated recipe
eg: It was the least exciting game of the season

tip: Use "less" with uncountable nouns (less water, less time) and "fewer" with countable nouns (fewer books)
tip: "Less" + adjective is the opposite of "more" + adjective
tip: "The least" can sound formal; in casual speech people often use "the ... -est" with negative adjectives (the cheapest, the simplest)

# as...as

form: as + adjective + as (equality)
form: not as + adjective + as (inequality)
form: just as + adjective + as (emphasized equality)
form: twice/half/three times + as + adjective + as (multiples)

use: To compare two things as equal or to express that one is not equal to the other
eg: She is as tall as her mother
eg: This car is not as fast as the other one
eg: The exam was just as difficult as I expected
eg: This laptop costs twice as much as that one
eg: My new phone is half as heavy as the old one
eg: He is three times as old as his nephew

tip: "Not as...as" means the same as "less...than" but is more common in spoken English
tip: "Just as" adds emphasis to the equality
tip: For multiples, the structure is: number + as + adjective + as (twice as big, half as expensive)

# comparative structures

form: the + comparative..., the + comparative (parallel increase or decrease)
form: more and more + adjective (gradual increase)
form: -er and -er (gradual increase with short adjectives)

use: To show that two things change together or that something is changing over time
eg: The more you practice, the better you get
eg: The sooner we leave, the earlier we will arrive
eg: The more I read, the more I want to learn
eg: It is getting more and more expensive to live here
eg: She is becoming more and more confident
eg: The weather is getting colder and colder
eg: He ran faster and faster as he approached the finish line

tip: Both clauses use the comparative form; the first clause is often a condition
tip: "More and more" and "-er and -er" suggest ongoing change
tip: "The...the" structure does not use "than"

# superlative structures

form: one of the + superlative + plural noun
form: the second/third + superlative (+ noun)
form: the + ordinal + superlative

use: To rank items or to place something within a top group
eg: She is one of the best players in the team
eg: This is one of the most beautiful places I have visited
eg: He is one of the tallest students in the school
eg: Mount Everest is the highest mountain; K2 is the second highest
eg: Tokyo is the most populous city; Delhi is the second most populous
eg: She came in third in the race

tip: "One of the" is always followed by a plural noun (one of the best players, not player)
tip: Use "the second/third" + superlative for ranking (the second largest, the third oldest)
tip: The verb agrees with the subject: "One of the best players is..." (singular)

# modifiers with comparatives

form: much/far/a lot + comparative (strong difference)
form: a little/slightly/a bit + comparative (small difference)
form: even/still + comparative (additional emphasis)

use: To show the degree of difference between two things
eg: She is much taller than her sister
eg: This car is far more expensive than I expected
eg: The new version is a lot better than the old one
eg: It is a little colder today than yesterday
eg: The second test was slightly easier than the first
eg: He is even more talented than his father
eg: She is still faster than most runners her age

tip: "Much" and "far" make the difference stronger; "a little" and "slightly" make it weaker
tip: "Even" suggests going beyond an already high level
tip: Never use "very" with comparatives (not "very taller"); use "much" or "far" instead

# modifiers with superlatives

form: by far + superlative
form: easily + superlative
form: the very + superlative

use: To emphasize that something is the extreme to a strong degree
eg: She is by far the best candidate for the job
eg: This is by far the most difficult exam I have taken
eg: He is easily the fastest runner in the school
eg: That was easily the worst movie of the year
eg: She is the very best friend I could ask for
eg: We had the very best time at the party

tip: "By far" emphasizes a large gap between the superlative and everything else
tip: "Easily" suggests there is no doubt about the ranking
tip: "The very" adds emotional emphasis; it is somewhat formal

# comparing with nouns

form: more/fewer + countable noun + than
form: more/less + uncountable noun + than
form: the most + noun (superlative with countable or uncountable)
form: the fewest + countable noun
form: the least + uncountable noun

use: To compare quantities of things
eg: She has more books than I do
eg: There are fewer students in this class than last year
eg: We need more time to finish the project
eg: He drinks less coffee than he used to
eg: She has the most experience of all the applicants
eg: This store has the fewest options
eg: We want the plan with the least risk

tip: Use "fewer" with countable nouns (fewer people, fewer mistakes); "less" with uncountable (less water, less sugar)
tip: "The most" can work with both countable and uncountable nouns
tip: "The fewest" is less common than "the least" but is correct for countable nouns

# comparing with adverbs

form: more + adverb + than (long adverbs)
form: adverb + -er + than (short adverbs: fast, hard, late, early)
form: the most + adverb (superlative)
form: irregular: well→better, badly→worse

use: To compare how actions are performed
eg: She speaks more quickly than her brother
eg: He works more efficiently than the others
eg: She runs faster than anyone else
eg: He arrived earlier than expected
eg: She drives more carefully than her husband
eg: He sings better than he used to
eg: She did worse on the test than last time
eg: He works the most efficiently of all the team members

tip: Most adverbs form comparatives with "more" (more slowly, more carefully)
tip: Short adverbs like fast, hard, late, early add -er (faster, harder, later, earlier)
tip: "Well" and "badly" are irregular: better, worse

# common mistakes

form: Wrong: more bigger, more taller, more faster
form: Correct: bigger, taller, faster (no "more" with -er)
form: Wrong: She is tall than her sister
form: Correct: She is taller than her sister (comparative + than)
form: Wrong: Of the two options, this is the best
form: Correct: Of the two options, this is the better (use comparative for two items)
form: Wrong: more better, more worse
form: Correct: better, worse (irregular forms do not take "more")
form: Wrong: the most biggest, the most best
form: Correct: the biggest, the best (no "most" with -est or irregular)

use: Avoid double comparatives, missing "than", and wrong form choice
eg: Wrong: This is more interestinger than that
eg: Correct: This is more interesting than that
eg: Wrong: He is more tall than me
eg: Correct: He is taller than me
eg: Wrong: Which is the best, tea or coffee?
eg: Correct: Which is better, tea or coffee?
eg: Wrong: She is the most happiest
eg: Correct: She is the happiest

tip: With two items, always use comparative (better, taller); use superlative only with three or more
tip: Never combine "more" or "most" with -er or -est forms
tip: Always include "than" after comparative adjectives when comparing two things
