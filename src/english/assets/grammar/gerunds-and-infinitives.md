title: English Gerunds and Infinitives
description: When to use gerunds (-ing) and infinitives (to + verb) in English, including verb lists, meaning changes, and common mistakes
---

# what is a gerund

form: Verb + -ing (used as a noun)

use: A gerund is the -ing form of a verb used as a noun — it can be a subject, object, or complement

eg: Swimming is my favorite sport (subject)

eg: I enjoy reading before bed (object)

eg: Her hobby is painting (complement)

tip: Gerunds look like present participles but function as nouns. If you can replace the -ing word with "it" or "that," it's likely a gerund.

# what is an infinitive

form: To + base verb

use: An infinitive is the base form of a verb with "to." It is used after certain verbs, to express purpose, and after adjectives

eg: She wants to leave early (after verb)

eg: I went to the store to buy milk (purpose)

eg: It's important to arrive on time (after adjective)

tip: The infinitive can function as a noun, adjective, or adverb depending on its position in the sentence.

# verbs followed by both (same meaning)

form: These verbs can take either gerund or infinitive with no change in meaning

use: begin, start, continue, like, love, hate, prefer, intend, bother, can't bear — interchangeable with both forms

eg: I began working / I began to work (both correct)

eg: She loves swimming / She loves to swim (both correct)

eg: He continued talking / He continued to talk (both correct)

eg: I like reading / I like to read (both correct)

eg: We prefer walking / We prefer to walk (both correct)

eg: I intend calling / I intend to call (both correct)

eg: Don't bother waiting / Don't bother to wait (both correct)

eg: I can't bear listening / I can't bear to listen (both correct)

tip: With "like," "love," "hate," and "prefer," the gerund often suggests a general preference while the infinitive can suggest a specific occasion, but both are commonly used interchangeably.

# verbs followed by both (different meaning)

remember + gerund: I remember locking the door (past action — you did it and recall it)

remember + infinitive: Remember to lock the door (future action — don't forget to do it)

forget + gerund: I'll never forget meeting her (past action — you did it and recall it)

forget + infinitive: Don't forget to call me (future action — don't fail to do it)

stop + gerund: He stopped smoking (quit smoking)

stop + infinitive: He stopped to smoke (paused in order to smoke)

try + gerund: Try adding more salt (experiment with this)

try + infinitive: Try to add more salt (make an effort to add it)

regret + gerund: I regret saying that (feel sorry about something in the past)

regret + infinitive: I regret to inform you (feel sorry about now, formal announcement)

go on + gerund: She went on talking (continued the same activity)

go on + infinitive: She went on to become a doctor (moved to the next thing)

mean + gerund: Success means working hard (involves, requires)

mean + infinitive: I meant to call you (intended)

need + gerund: The car needs fixing (passive meaning — the car needs to be fixed)

need + infinitive: I need to fix the car (active meaning — I must fix it)

tip: This is one of the most common areas for mistakes. Memorize the difference between "remember" and "forget" with both forms — gerund is past, infinitive is future.

# gerund after prepositions

form: Verb or adjective + preposition + gerund (never infinitive)

use: After any preposition, you must use a gerund, not an infinitive

eg: I'm interested in learning Spanish

eg: She's good at cooking

eg: He's tired of waiting

eg: Thank you for helping me

eg: I'm looking forward to seeing you

eg: She's afraid of flying

eg: He's responsible for organizing the event

eg: We're used to getting up early

eg: She succeeded in passing the exam

eg: I'm thinking about changing jobs

eg: He apologized for being late

eg: They're capable of winning

tip: "To" can be a preposition (interested in, look forward to) or part of the infinitive. When "to" is a preposition, it must be followed by a gerund.

# infinitive of purpose

form: To + base verb (meaning "in order to")

use: The infinitive explains why someone does something

eg: I went to the store to buy milk

eg: She studies hard to pass the exam

eg: He works overtime to save money

eg: We're leaving early to avoid traffic

eg: She called to confirm the appointment

eg: I'm learning English to get a better job

tip: You can often add "in order" before "to" for emphasis: "I went to the store in order to buy milk." The meaning is the same.

# bare infinitive (without "to")

form: Base verb only, no "to"

use: Used after modal verbs, let, make, sense verbs, had better, and would rather

eg: I can swim (after modal: can, could, may, might, must, shall, should, will, would)

eg: Let me go (after let)

eg: She made him apologize (after make)

eg: I saw him leave (after sense verb: see, hear, watch, feel, notice + object + bare infinitive)

eg: I heard her sing (sense verb + object + bare infinitive)

eg: We watched them play (sense verb + object + bare infinitive)

eg: You had better leave now (after had better)

eg: I would rather stay home (after would rather)

tip: With "make" in passive voice, use the infinitive with "to": "He was made to apologize." With "let" in passive, "be allowed to" is used instead.

# common mistakes

Wrong: I enjoy to read (enjoy takes gerund only)

Correct: I enjoy reading

Wrong: She suggested to leave early (suggest takes gerund only)

Correct: She suggested leaving early

Wrong: I'm interested in to learn (preposition + gerund, not infinitive)

Correct: I'm interested in learning

Wrong: She's good at to cook (preposition + gerund)

Correct: She's good at cooking

Wrong: I look forward to see you (to is preposition here, needs gerund)

Correct: I look forward to seeing you

Wrong: I forgot locking the door (forgot + gerund = past, forgot + infinitive = didn't do)

Correct: I forgot to lock the door (meaning: I didn't lock it)

Wrong: Remember locking the door when you leave (wrong form for future reminder)

Correct: Remember to lock the door when you leave

Wrong: The car needs to fix (need + gerund for passive meaning with things)

Correct: The car needs fixing (or: The car needs to be fixed)

Wrong: He made me to apologize (make + object + bare infinitive)

Correct: He made me apologize

Wrong: She let me to go (let + object + bare infinitive)

Correct: She let me go

tip: When in doubt, check a verb list. The most frequent errors are using infinitive after prepositions and mixing up remember/forget with gerund vs infinitive.
