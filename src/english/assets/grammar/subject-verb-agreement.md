title: English Subject-Verb Agreement
---

# basic rule

rule: A singular subject takes a singular verb; a plural subject takes a plural verb
eg: The dog runs in the park every morning (singular)
eg: The dogs run in the park every morning (plural)
eg: She has a new car (singular)
eg: They have new cars (plural)

tip: Add -s or -es to the verb for third person singular in present tense
tip: Plural nouns and I/you/we/they take the base form of the verb (no -s)

# compound subjects with "and"

rule: Compound subjects joined by "and" usually take a plural verb. Exception: when they refer to one thing or person, use a singular verb
eg: Tom and Jerry are friends (plural)
eg: My brother and sister live in London (plural)
eg: Bread and butter is my favorite breakfast (one thing)
eg: Fish and chips is a popular British dish (one dish)

tip: If you can replace the compound with "it," use singular
tip: Names of dishes and paired items often take singular verbs

# compound subjects with "or" / "nor"

rule: When subjects are joined by "or" or "nor," the verb agrees with the nearest subject
eg: Neither the teacher nor the students were ready
eg: Either the cat or the dogs are responsible
eg: Neither the books nor the laptop was found
eg: My parents or my brother is picking me up

tip: Place the plural subject closer to the verb to avoid awkward phrasing
tip: "Neither...nor" and "either...or" follow the same rule

# indefinite pronouns

rule: Everyone, everybody, everything, someone, somebody, anyone, anybody, no one, nobody, each, either, neither take singular verbs. Some, few, both, many take plural verbs
eg: Everyone is invited to the party
eg: Nobody knows the answer
eg: Each of the students has a textbook
eg: Some of the cake was eaten (singular when referring to uncountable)
eg: Many of the students are absent today
eg: Both of them are correct

tip: "Each" and "every" are always singular even when followed by "of the"
tip: "Some" and "all" can be singular or plural depending on what they refer to

# collective nouns

rule: Collective nouns (team, family, class, government, audience, committee, staff) take singular verbs in American English and can take plural verbs in British English when emphasizing individual members
eg: The team is winning (American)
eg: The team are arguing among themselves (British)
eg: The family was gathered for dinner
eg: The committee has made its decision
eg: The staff are on their lunch break (British, emphasizing individuals)

tip: In American English, collective nouns are almost always singular
tip: In British English, use plural when the group acts as individuals

# uncountable nouns

rule: Uncountable nouns always take singular verbs
eg: Information is available online
eg: The news was shocking
eg: Furniture has become expensive
eg: Homework takes up most of my evening
eg: Money doesn't grow on trees
eg: Traffic was heavy this morning

tip: Uncountable nouns have no plural form and cannot use "a" or numbers
tip: Common uncountable nouns: information, advice, news, furniture, equipment, luggage, homework, knowledge, money, music, traffic, weather, work

# "there is" / "there are"

rule: The verb agrees with the noun that follows "there"
eg: There is a book on the table
eg: There are three books on the table
eg: There was a problem with the order
eg: There have been many complaints

tip: Find the real subject after "there" to choose the correct verb
tip: In informal speech, "there's" is often used with plurals, but avoid in writing

# amounts, distances, and periods of time

rule: Amounts, distances, and periods of time are treated as singular units
eg: Five miles is a long walk
eg: Ten dollars is enough for lunch
eg: Two hours was too long to wait
eg: Fifty percent of the vote is required to win

tip: Think of the amount as one unit, not individual items
tip: "A lot of" and "lots of" agree with the noun that follows: "A lot of people are here"

# titles and names

rule: Titles of books, movies, countries, and organizations are always singular even if they look plural
eg: The United States is a large country
eg: Harry Potter is a popular series
eg: The Rolling Stones is a famous band
eg: Physics is my favorite subject

tip: Treat the whole title or name as one unit
tip: "The Philippines" and "The Netherlands" are singular

# subjects with "as well as", "along with", "together with"

rule: When the subject is followed by "as well as," "along with," or "together with," the verb agrees with the first subject only
eg: The teacher, as well as the students, was surprised
eg: My sister, along with her friends, is coming to visit
eg: The president, together with his advisors, has left the building
eg: The book, as well as the movie, was a success

tip: These phrases add extra information but do not make the subject plural
tip: The same rule applies to "in addition to," "including," and "accompanied by"

# "none"

rule: "None" can take either a singular or plural verb depending on context and emphasis
eg: None of the cake was left (singular, emphasizing the whole)
eg: None of the students were present (plural, emphasizing individuals)
eg: None of it matters anymore
eg: None of them have arrived yet

tip: Singular is more formal; plural is common when "none" refers to countable nouns
tip: "None" literally means "not one," so singular is grammatically defensible

# "the number of" vs "a number of"

rule: "The number of" takes a singular verb; "a number of" takes a plural verb
eg: The number of students is increasing
eg: A number of students are absent today
eg: The number of complaints has risen
eg: A number of options are available

tip: "The number" = one specific number (singular). "A number" = several/many (plural)
tip: Same pattern: "the majority of" + noun can be singular or plural; "a majority of" + plural noun = plural verb

# gerunds and infinitives as subjects

rule: Gerunds (-ing form) and infinitives (to + verb) used as subjects take singular verbs
eg: Swimming is great exercise
eg: To err is human
eg: Reading books improves your vocabulary
eg: To travel the world is her dream

tip: Treat the whole phrase as one idea or activity
tip: Gerunds and infinitives as subjects are always singular

# relative clauses

rule: The verb in a relative clause agrees with the antecedent (the word the clause describes)
eg: She is one of the students who are always on time (who refers to students)
eg: She is the only one of the students who is always on time (who refers to one)
eg: He is one of those people who never forget a face
eg: This is one of the books that were recommended

tip: Check whether "one of" or "the only one of" comes before the relative pronoun
tip: "The only one of the X who" = singular. "One of the X who" = plural

# inverted sentences

rule: In inverted sentences (subject after verb), the verb still agrees with the subject
eg: On the table are two books
eg: Here comes the bus
eg: There goes my last chance
eg: In the box was a surprise
eg: Under the bed were three pairs of shoes

tip: Find the subject by asking "who" or "what" performs the action
tip: Common inversions: "Here is/are," "There is/are," and sentences beginning with place phrases

# common mistakes

rule: Frequent errors include using plural verbs with singular subjects, wrong agreement with intervening phrases, and confusion with indefinite pronouns
eg: Wrong: The list of items are on the desk. Correct: The list of items is on the desk
eg: Wrong: One of the boys have a bike. Correct: One of the boys has a bike
eg: Wrong: Everybody have their own opinion. Correct: Everybody has his or her own opinion (or use "has" with "their" in informal usage)
eg: Wrong: The data shows. Correct: The data show (data is plural; datum is singular)
eg: Wrong: Each of the children want ice cream. Correct: Each of the children wants ice cream

tip: Ignore phrases between the subject and verb when checking agreement
tip: "Data" and "media" are technically plural but often used as singular in modern English
