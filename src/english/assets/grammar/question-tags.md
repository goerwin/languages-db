# basic rule

rule: Positive statement → negative tag; negative statement → positive tag
form: Statement + , + auxiliary verb (+ not) + subject pronoun + ?
eg: You are coming to the party, aren't you?
eg: She doesn't like coffee, does she?
eg: He can swim, can't he?
eg: They won't be late, will they?
tip: The tag always mirrors the opposite polarity of the main statement.
tip: The tag uses the same auxiliary verb as the main clause, or do/does/did if there is no auxiliary.

# question tags with "be"

rule: Use the appropriate form of "be" in the tag, matching the tense of the statement.
form: Subject + am/is/are/was/were + complement + , + be (neg/pos) + subject pronoun + ?
eg: You're tired, aren't you?
eg: She was late, wasn't she?
eg: They are from London, aren't they?
eg: He wasn't at home, was he?
tip: Contracted forms are common in tags: aren't, isn't, wasn't, weren't.
tip: For "I am", use "aren't I?" (see special section).

# question tags with auxiliaries

rule: Use the same auxiliary in the tag as in the main clause; add "not" for negative tags.
form: Statement with have/has, do/does/did, will/would, can/could, should, might, must + , + auxiliary (± not) + subject pronoun + ?
eg: You have finished, haven't you?
eg: She will help us, won't she?
eg: He can speak French, can't he?
eg: They should leave now, shouldn't they?
tip: Modal auxiliaries (will, can, should, etc.) repeat in the tag.
tip: "Must" for obligation: "You must go, mustn't you?" For deduction: "That must be John, mustn't it?" or "can't it?"

# question tags with present simple

rule: Use do/does in the tag because present simple has no auxiliary.
form: Subject + base form / -s form + , + do/does (± not) + subject pronoun + ?
eg: You like pizza, don't you?
eg: She works here, doesn't she?
eg: They live in Paris, don't they?
eg: He doesn't eat meat, does he?
tip: Use "does" for he/she/it; "do" for I/you/we/they.
tip: The main verb stays in base form in the tag; only do/does appears.

# question tags with past simple

rule: Use did in the tag because past simple has no auxiliary.
form: Subject + past tense verb + , + did (± not) + subject pronoun + ?
eg: They went home, didn't they?
eg: You saw the movie, didn't you?
eg: She didn't call, did she?
eg: He left early, didn't he?
tip: All past simple verbs use "did" in the tag, regardless of the main verb.
tip: Never use the past tense of the main verb in the tag; always use did.

# question tags with "have to" and "used to"

rule: "Have to" and "used to" behave like main verbs; use do/does/did in the tag.
form: Subject + have to / used to + base form + , + do/does/did (± not) + subject pronoun + ?
eg: You have to leave, don't you?
eg: He used to smoke, didn't he?
eg: She has to work tomorrow, doesn't she?
eg: They used to live here, didn't they?
tip: "Have to" is not the auxiliary "have"; treat it like a normal verb and use do/does.
tip: "Used to" always takes "did" in the tag: "used to" + "didn't" or "used to" + "did".

# question tags with "I am"

rule: Special case: use "aren't I?" because "amn't" does not exist in standard English.
form: I am + complement + , + aren't I + ?
eg: I am right, aren't I?
eg: I'm late, aren't I?
eg: I am invited, aren't I?
eg: I'm being silly, aren't I?
tip: "Aren't I?" is the only standard form; "amn't I?" is non-standard or dialectal.
tip: This exception applies only when the subject is "I" and the verb is "am".

# question tags with imperatives

rule: Use "will you?" for most imperatives; use "shall we?" for "Let's" invitations.
form: Imperative + , + will you? / Don't + imperative + , + will you? / Let's + base form + , + shall we?
eg: Close the door, will you?
eg: Don't forget, will you?
eg: Let's go, shall we?
eg: Help me with this, will you?
tip: "Will you?" is polite for requests; "won't you?" is also possible for invitations.
tip: "Let's" always takes "shall we?" never "will we?" or "do we?"

# question tags with "nobody", "nothing", "never", etc.

rule: These words make the statement negative, so the tag is positive.
form: Nobody/Nothing/Never/etc. + verb + , + auxiliary (positive) + they/it + ?
eg: Nobody called, did they?
eg: She never goes out, does she?
eg: Nothing happened, did it?
eg: You've never been there, have you?
tip: "Nobody", "no one", "nothing" are grammatically negative; the tag must be positive.
tip: Use "they" for nobody/no one; use "it" for nothing.

# question tags with "somebody", "everybody", "no one"

rule: Use "they" as the pronoun in the tag for indefinite pronouns.
form: Somebody/Everybody/No one + verb + , + auxiliary (± not) + they + ?
eg: Everybody knows, don't they?
eg: Someone left their bag, didn't they?
eg: No one saw you, did they?
eg: Everybody enjoyed the party, didn't they?
tip: "They" is used for singular indefinite pronouns (someone, everybody, no one) in tags.
tip: Match the auxiliary to the main verb: "everybody knows" → "don't they?" (present simple).

# intonation and meaning

rule: Rising intonation = genuine question (unsure); falling intonation = expecting agreement (rhetorical).
form: Same tag, different intonation conveys different meaning.
eg: You're coming, aren't you? (falling: I expect you to agree)
eg: You're coming, aren't you? (rising: I'm not sure, please confirm)
eg: She lives here, doesn't she? (falling: I think so, seeking confirmation)
eg: He left, didn't he? (rising: I'm uncertain)
tip: Falling intonation is more common; we often use tags to seek agreement, not information.
tip: In writing, intonation is not shown; context determines the intended meaning.

# same-way question tags

rule: Positive statement + positive tag (or negative + negative) for surprise, sarcasm, or interest.
form: Statement + , + same-polarity tag + ?
eg: So you're getting married, are you?
eg: Oh, she thinks she's clever, does she?
eg: So you don't like it, don't you?
eg: You've been lying, have you?
tip: Same-way tags express emotions: surprise, disbelief, sarcasm, or interest.
tip: These are less common than opposite-polarity tags; use when the speaker has a strong reaction.

# common mistakes

rule: Avoid wrong auxiliary, wrong pronoun, double negatives, and overusing "isn't it?"
form: Match auxiliary to statement; use correct pronoun; ensure one negative only.
eg: Wrong: You like it, isn't it? Correct: You like it, don't you?
eg: Wrong: She's coming, doesn't she? Correct: She's coming, isn't she?
eg: Wrong: Nobody came, didn't they? Correct: Nobody came, did they?
eg: Wrong: I am right, amn't I? Correct: I am right, aren't I?
tip: Double negative error: "You don't like it, don't you?" is wrong; use "do you?"
tip: "Isn't it?" is only correct when the statement contains "is"; do not use it as a universal tag.
